</p>
<p>
Lets look at the "Entire mobile online banking is down" ticket, and begin modifying it for the right users.
<p>First off, this is a big priority, since it is affecting the entire banking system and their business impact.

We'll update the priority to "emergency" and provide a note of why.

Now the ticket must be assigned to the proper team/agent

<br />

Next, the SLA will be updated, so that the proper teams know how urgent the issue is.

The proper department must also be assigned, and support should be changed to a more cricial department

When updating and transfering levels, plans, tickets, etc., all of the updates can be seen on the ticket itself. (Via the ticket thread)

Replies can be posted from the section at the bottom.
<p>We'll post that we've coordinated with the system admins and have communicated to have the issue resolved.
<p>NOTE: The reply will be posted on the ticket thread
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vmGim33.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

We will now post a reply that states the issue has been resolved, and we'll close out the ticket as "resolved"

Any Tickets that have been resolved can be seen on the "Closed" Tickets tab.
